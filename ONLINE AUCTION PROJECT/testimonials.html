<p>We recently undertook Bid Writing Training with Matthew from Executive Compass. This training was invaluable to our company, as we will now be looking at our process of writing bids in a completely different way ..The training day was structured at a good pace and allowed time for questions and interaction. We would definitely recommend using the services of Executive Compass to enhance your chances of being successful with tender bids.</p>

<p>We engaged Executive Compass for their objective thinking and pragmatism in reviewing tenders submissions. We presented them with a challenging deadline, and were thoroughly impressed with not only the quick turnaround but the high quality of output. Executive Compass delivered exactly what we asked for, in a manner exceeding expectation. Having Executive Compass on hand to support with our big ticket opportunities has proved very worthwhile.</p>

<p>We have used the services of Executive Compass twice now, once for our tender bid in 2016 and again this year in 2018. We have been highly successful on both occasions. We have found working with the team to be excellent, they are always professional and helpful. I would highly recommend working with Executive Compass.

<p>Though we don’t tender a lot we wanted to improve the quality of our bids, so brought in Matthew from Executive Compass to take us through his one-day workshop. He really knows his stuff. From deconstructing questions to getting into the head of the buyer, Matthew’s knowledge and experience shone through.

We were fairly hesitant in spending a bit of budget on bid writing services, we researched lots of companies and Executive Compass always seemed to come out at the top of our searches. From our initial correspondence with the team our minds were put at ease and we knew straight away they were the company to use.

The team at Executive Compass came to our rescue when we were struggling with a lengthy and difficult PQQ and ITT. We contacted them at very short notice but nothing was too much trouble and they pulled all their resources together to ensure the deadline was met.

It is my absolute pleasure to recommend Tom and Executive Compass. Tom's knowledge and expertise in bid writing is a huge advantage to our entire organisation. He has successfully supported us to win various NHS contracts and has delivered an amazing, cost-effective service.

<p>
When we first contacted Executive Compass, we knew that we needed training but we did not know what we needed training on. From our initial discussions through to the in-house training, Matthew guided us each step of the way, using previous tender submissions to identify our weaknesses and worked through these in a easy to understand and jargon free way.

We had decided that our bid writing required more finesse, so after some research we found Executive Compass. From their initial consultation they provided us with confidence via the professionalism, attention to detail and level of communication and commitment. We engaged their services for a Fusion 21 framework contract which has proved to have a successful outcome and have since engaged their services for other future contracts.

Resource have worked alongside the team at Executive Compass for two years refining and improving our PQQ & ITT submissions and more importantly gaining an insight into our business model, both sides have invested time to build the relationship and a substantial bid library has been developed.

Executive Compass® come highly recommended. We requested their services at very short notice and the team helped us with their expertise in the bid writing process for our new crime duty provider contract. Without the team we could not have achieved a successful tender.

In January 2015 I spent a day with Neil Capstick taking me through the rigours of PQQ’s and tendering and, being a relative novice, I found the day to be an absolute joy! I learned invaluable knowledge and was presented with information, instruction and training bespoke to my role and industry.
